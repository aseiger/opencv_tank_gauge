## Documentation

Full instructions are located on [Project Wiki](https://github.com/tangentaudio/opencv_tank_gauge/wiki)

## Software Quick Start

Advanced users can skip straight to the installer script, which installs all pre-requisites and configures system services.  Find it at `install.sh` in the project root directory.  This is best done on a fresh Raspberry Pi OS Lite 32-bit installation. [Full installation instructions](https://github.com/tangentaudio/opencv_tank_gauge/wiki/Software-Installation) are on the wiki.

## 3D Printed Enclosure

A custom 3D printed enclosure holds all of the parts.  Jump over to the [Mechanical Assembly](https://github.com/tangentaudio/opencv_tank_gauge/wiki/Mechanical-Assembly) section of the wiki to read how to print and build it.
