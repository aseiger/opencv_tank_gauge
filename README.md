## Documentation

Full mechanical assembly, electronics assembly, and software installation instructions are located on the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/tangentaudio/opencv_tank_gauge/wiki)

## Software Quick Start

Advanced users can skip straight to the installer script, which installs all pre-requisites and configures system services.  Find it at `install.sh` in the project root directory.  This is best done on a fresh Raspberry Pi OS Lite 32-bit installation.
